# Ad-Hoc design 

Ad-hoc design refers to a problem-solving approach that involves creating a solution or design without using a pre-existing plan or template. In other words, ad-hoc design is a method of designing or creating something based on the needs and requirements of a particular situation, rather than relying on preconceived ideas or established procedures.

Ad-hoc design is often used in situations where the problem or task at hand is complex and does not fit neatly into a pre-existing framework or structure. This approach allows for greater flexibility and creativity in problem-solving, as it allows designers and developers to tailor their solutions to the specific needs of the problem at hand.

One example of ad-hoc design in the field of artificial intelligence is the design of custom neural network architectures to solve specific problems. Instead of using a pre-existing neural network architecture, researchers may design a custom architecture that is tailored to the specific requirements of their problem. This can involve creating new types of layers or modifying existing layers to better fit the problem at hand.

Ad-hoc design can also be applied in other areas of AI, such as reinforcement learning and natural language processing. In reinforcement learning, for example, ad-hoc design can be used to create custom reward functions or state representations that are better suited to the specific problem being solved. Similarly, in natural language processing, ad-hoc design can be used to create custom language models or neural architectures that are better suited to the specific language or task being analyzed.
