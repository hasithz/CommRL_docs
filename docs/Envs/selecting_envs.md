# Selecting Environments 

There are mainly 2 types of environments are used in multi agent environments. 

## Mini-grid environments 
**[mini grid environments](https://minigrid.farama.org/)**
The environment mentioned above is for a single agent and has many scenarios mentioned in it. 

This library contains a collection of 2D grid-world environments with goal-oriented tasks. The agent in these environments is a triangle-like agent with a discrete action space. The tasks involve solving different maze maps and interacting with different objects such as doors, keys, or boxes. The design of the library is meant to be simple, fast, and easily customizable.

In addition, the environments found in the BabyAI repository have been included in Minigrid and will be further maintained under this library.

## MPE

**[MPE](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/environments/mpe/)**
This has 9 environment types. 
Multi Particle Environments (MPE) are a set of communication oriented environment where particle agents can (sometimes) move, communicate, see each other, push each other around, and interact with fixed landmarks.

These environments are from OpenAIâ€™s MPE codebase, with several minor fixes, mostly related to making the action space discrete by default, making the rewards consistent and cleaning up the observation space of certain environments.
