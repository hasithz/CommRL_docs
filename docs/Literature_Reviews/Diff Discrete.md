stochastic message encoding/decoding procedure that makes a discrete communication channel mathematically equivalent to an analog channel with additive noise, through which gradients can be backpropagated

differentiable communication learning approach that can compute unbiased derivatives through channels with unknown noise.

differentiable communication learning that utilizes a randomized message encoding scheme to make discrete (and therefore non-differentiable) communication channels behave mathematically like a differentiable, analog communication channel.
