The core idea behind RRL is to combine reinforcement learning with relational learning or Inductive Logic Programming [16] by representing states, actions and policies using a first order (or relational) language [8, 9, 17, 18]. Moving from a propositional to a relational representation facilitates generalization over goals, states, and actions, exploiting knowledge learnt during an earlier learning phase.
