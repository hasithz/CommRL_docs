An overview of IC3Net. (Left) In-depth view of a single communication step. LSTM gets hidden state, ht and cell state, st (not shown) from previous time-step. Hidden state ht is passed to Communication-Action module fg for a communication binary action gt. Finally, communication vector ct is calculated by averaging hidden states of other active agents gated by their communication action act and is passed through a linear transformation C before fed to LSTM along with the observation. (Right) High-level view of IC3Net which optimizes individual rewards rt for each agent based on observation ot.

<!-- has better training efficiency than simple continuous communication model, and can be applied to semi-cooperative and competitive settings along with the cooperative settings

C3Net controls continuous communication with a gating mechanism and uses individualized rewards for each agent to gain better performance and scalability while fixing credit assignment issues.

We propose Individualized Controlled Continuous Communication Model (IC3Net), in which each agent is trained with its individualized reward and can be applied to any scenario whether cooperative or not. 2. We empirically show that based on the given scenario–using the gating mechanism–our model can learn when to communicate. The gating mechanism allows agents to block their communication; which is useful in competitive scenarios. 3. We conduct experiments on different scales in three chosen environments including StarCraft and show that IC3Net outperforms the baselines with performance gaps that increase with scale. The results show that individual rewards converge faster and better than global rewards.

we move away from the single big network controller approach. Instead, we consider multiple big networks with shared parameters each controlling a single agent separately. Each big network consists of multiple LSTM networks, each processing an observation of a single agent. However, only one of the LSTMs need to output an action because the big network is only controlling a single agent. Although this view has a little effect on the implementation (we can still use a single big network in practice), it allows us to train each agent to maximize its individual reward instead of a single global reward. This has two benefits: (i) it allows the model to be applied to both cooperative and competitive scenarios, (ii) it also helps resolve the credit assignment issue faced by many multi-agent -->

The Individualized Controlled Continuous Communication Model (IC3Net) is an extension of Sukhbaatar et al.'s (2016) CommNet for collaboration among multiple agents using continuous communication. However, unlike CommNet, IC3Net is usable in both cooperative and non-cooperative settings, making it suitable for a wider range of scenarios. While CommNet uses a global reward for all agents, which suffers from credit assignment issues, IC3Net uses individualized rewards for each agent to resolve this issue.

IC3Net controls continuous communication with a gating mechanism, allowing agents to learn when to communicate based on the given scenario. This gating mechanism also enables agents to block their communication, which is useful in competitive scenarios. The experiments conducted on different scales in three environments, including StarCraft, demonstrate that IC3Net outperforms the baselines with increasing performance gaps as the scale of the environment increases. The use of individualized rewards allows for faster and better convergence compared to using a single global reward.

In contrast to the single big network controller approach used in CommNet, IC3Net uses multiple big networks with shared parameters, with each big network controlling a single agent separately. This allows for training each agent to maximize its individual reward, rather than a single global reward, which helps resolve the credit assignment issue faced by many multi-agent systems. This approach has two benefits: it allows the model to be applied to both cooperative and non-cooperative scenarios, and it also increases the scalability and performance of the model. Overall, IC3Net is a promising approach for multi-agent collaboration in various scenarios.

To summarize, IC3Net is a communication model for multi-agent collaboration that uses individualized rewards and a gating mechanism to control continuous communication among agents. Unlike its predecessor, CommNet, IC3Net is usable in both cooperative and non-cooperative settings, and resolves the credit assignment issue through the use of individualized rewards. The experiments conducted on different scales in various environments demonstrate that IC3Net outperforms the baselines with increasing performance gaps as the scale of the environment increases. The use of multiple big networks with shared parameters, each controlling a single agent separately, increases the scalability and performance of the model. Overall, IC3Net is a promising approach for multi-agent collaboration in various scenarios.
